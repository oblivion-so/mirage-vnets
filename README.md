Ship confidently with mainnet-accurate testing that won't break the bank. Mirage is building a virtual testnet platform that will perfectly simulate mainnet conditions for comprehensive dApp testing.

## Mission
We're building a future where every Web3 developer can perfect their dApps through reliable, affordable testing environments.

## Planned Features

- 🔄 **Real Mainnet Environment**: Test in an environment that perfectly mirrors mainnet conditions, from gas prices to network congestion
- ∞ **Unlimited Testing**: No transaction limits. No restrictions. Test your dApp as thoroughly as you need
- 💰 **Cost-Effective**: Enterprise-grade testing infrastructure at a fraction of market costs
- 🔗 **Multi-Chain Support**: Test across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and other major networks
- 🔌 **Native Hardhat Integration**: Seamless integration with your existing development workflow
- 🚰 **Smart Faucet Management**: Automated faucet distribution and balance management

## Planned Architecture

Our proposed architecture consists of four main components:

1. **Network Simulation Engine**: Core component that will replicate mainnet conditions
2. **Auto-Sync System**: Will maintain real-time synchronization with mainnet state
3. **Faucet Management**: Will handle automated token distribution
4. **Development Integration**: Will provide seamless integration with development tools

## Development Status

This project is in the initial development phase. Here's what's happening:
